Mobile Engineer – Project Brief
1. Create a universal application (phone & tablet) that pulls a list of items from a public API (i.e., movies, images, book titles, or whatever interests you personally)
2. Display a collection of high level info (i.e., title, date, etc.)
3. If an item is selected, present a detailed view of that item (i.e., preview image, description, etc.)
Tech Requirements:
• iOS:useSwift5.0w/abasetargetofiOS12.x
• Android:useAndroid9.xasthebasetarget
Take Note:
With this project we’re primarily concerned about the clean, clear, and maintainable implementation. Bonus points for interesting visual design and animations, but not at expense of good architecture.
